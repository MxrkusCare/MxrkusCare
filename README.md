- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @MxrkusCare

 Iâ€™m interested in whatever connections you might be making

So far Iâ€™ve read BOTNS, Fifth Head of Cerberus, the Wizard Knight, A Borrowed Man and Interlibrary Loan, and Iâ€™m currently partway through Castle of Days. Gene Wolfe is certainly one of those authors whose every work is more fascinating the more of the rest of his work youâ€™ve read, and the more you know about him. For me, he and Flannery O'Connor are the king and queen of that category of literature in which life of the author and work of the author are one organism.
